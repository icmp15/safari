~CANCELLED~
Airport: Lilongwe - 165 km NW from capital city
Entry from motorway: Lisitu gate.

Animal: Elephat, hippo, buffalo, bucks, deer, zebra. possibly: lion, leopard, cats

Visitors can hire a guide to walk to historical sites such as the famous Solonje rock paintings, Matungulu rock shelter and the iron smelting furnace at Miondwe.

Mountain climbers may climb Black Rock and Wang’ombe Rumen for panoramic views of the park.

**general view** : under developed, less animal density. not many facilities.

stay: some lodge near Lifupa dam. Animal sightings are rare and generally by the dam..damn we are going in rainy season - so they won't come for water.
